    Jolyne wakes up in the visiting room, everything covered in white goop.
    She realizes that there was never a secret passage and that she was never fighting Johngalli A.
    Ever since Jotaro pointed out the lit cigarette, the two have been asleep, hallucinating.
    Holding the bone given to her by Emporio had wounded her hand, allowing her to rouse.
    She tries to send a string over to Jotaro,but the string dissolves in the air.
    She summons Stone Free, using it to break the table.
